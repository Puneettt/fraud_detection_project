I have done here step by step approach on dealing with solving basic machine learning problem. My focus is to give beginners an overview of how some smart algorithms like **Support Vector Machines and Decision Tree** works.

I tried explaining about the overview of maximum margin classifier along with the logic involved with the sklearn wrappers. It's pretty important to learn what actually happens on back of the algorithm. How maths, hyperplanes and decision boundaries and other tuning parameters should be optimize to formulate the best model.

I hope you like it. Thanks.
