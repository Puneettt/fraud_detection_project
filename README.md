Here I have done step by step approach on dealing with solving basic machine learning problem. My focus was to give beginners an overview of how some smart algorithms like **Support Vector Machines and Decision Tree** algorithms work.

I tried explaining about the overview of maximum margin classifier as it's pretty important to learn what actually happens back of the algorithm. How maths, hyperplanes and decision boundaries and other tuning parameters should be optimize to formulate the best model.

I hope you like it. Thanks.
